Market Basket Analysis for E-commerce Dataset
Overview
This project performs Market Basket Analysis on an e-commerce dataset, identifying frequent itemsets and association rules to gain insights into customer purchasing behaviors. Using the Apriori algorithm, we explore patterns in the dataset and analyze associations between items frequently bought together.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transaction data from an e-commerce platform, including information on products, quantities, and transaction details. Key columns in the dataset include:

InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction.
StockCode: Product code.
Description: Description of the product.
Quantity: Number of items purchased in each transaction.
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction.
UnitPrice: Price per unit of each product.
CustomerID: Unique identifier for the customer.
Country: Country where the customer is located.
Dataset Path
The dataset should be placed in the project directory under the filename data.csv.

Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Checked for and removed rows with missing values in essential columns like CustomerID.
Data Conversion: Converted relevant columns (InvoiceNo, StockCode) to string data types for consistency.
2. Transaction Matrix Creation
Constructed a transaction matrix where each transaction (InvoiceNo) is represented by items (Description) bought, indicated with binary values (1 for purchased, 0 for not purchased).

3. Applying Apriori Algorithm
Used the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets with a minimum support threshold of 0.05, representing products often bought together.

4. Association Rule Generation
Generated association rules from the frequent itemsets using the lift metric with a minimum threshold of 1. This step helps identify strong relationships between items frequently bought together.

5. Data Visualization
Several visualizations were created to help interpret the dataset and findings:

Top 10 Most Frequently Purchased Products: Displays the most popular items based on the frequency of purchase.
Support Distribution of Items: Histogram of item support values across transactions, showing how often different items appear.
Getting Started
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, mlxtend, matplotlib, seaborn
Installation
To install the required libraries, use the following command:

pip install pandas mlxtend matplotlib seaborn

Running the Project
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Place the dataset in the project directory under the filename data.csv.
Run the notebook or script in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
Execute the cells to perform data preprocessing, transaction matrix creation, Apriori analysis, and visualizations.

Results
The outputs of this project include:
Frequent Itemsets: Item combinations that commonly occur together.
Association Rules: Key association rules showing items frequently bought together, including metrics like support, confidence, and lift.
Visualizations: Plots to aid in understanding item popularity and distribution.
Example Outputs:
Top 10 Most Purchased Products: A bar chart of the most frequently bought items.
Support Distribution: Histogram showing the frequency of itemsâ€™ support across all transactions.

Insights Gained
Frequent Item Combinations: Highlights common pairings of items, providing insights into cross-selling opportunities.
Association Rules: Strong associations between certain items that may inform product bundling and marketing strategies.
Support Distribution: Distribution of item support can inform inventory decisions and highlight key products.

Notes
The Apriori algorithm requires sufficient support thresholds to avoid generating excessive itemsets. Adjusting support and lift thresholds may refine results.
Data preprocessing is crucial to ensure accurate transaction representation and reliable itemset generation.
